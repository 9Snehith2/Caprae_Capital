# AI-Ready Lead Generation Tool ‚Äì Submission Report

## üß† Project Overview

This submission reimagines the [Saasquatch Leads](https://www.saasquatchleads.com) tool through the lens of AI-readiness, focusing on enhancing **decision support**, **automation**, and **lead prioritization**. In line with Caprae‚Äôs mission to empower post-acquisition growth using AI, this project simulates key lead generation workflows while showcasing how even lightweight AI features can deliver high-value impact in B2B sales.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Approach

The project focuses on **Quality First** ‚Äî enhancing key lead interaction points with AI rather than replicating the full scraping stack. The system is built modularly using **Streamlit** for UI and **transformers** for AI, with the following emphasis:

- **UX**: Clean tab-based layout with intuitive controls and data views
- **AI**: Embeds NLP-based summarization, categorization, and scoring
- **Scalability**: Code modularity enables real integration with future scraping or CRM pipelines

## ü§ñ Model Selection

| Feature         | Model / Method                                      | Why Chosen                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Summarization  | `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` (Hugging Face)       | Lightweight, efficient, well-trained for news-style summaries |
| Categorization | Rule-based keyword tagging                           | Interpretable and fast for early deployment |
| Lead Scoring   | Rule-based heuristic (Revenue + Employees)           | Business-aligned logic to simulate AI ranking models |

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

Since real-time scraping was out of scope for this exercise, a **mock dataset** was used, reflecting realistic company descriptions, revenue, and employee counts. All data is formatted into a dictionary list, supporting easy filtering and manipulation across components.
